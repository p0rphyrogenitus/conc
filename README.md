# `conc::`

This project aims to make concurrent programming in C++ easier for those of us who have grown fond of Java's
concurrency model and constructs. Since I'm not building out the concurrency model or tools for a whole language,
I'm scoping down the interfaces a bit, but many of the constructs and interfaces defined herein will look familiar to
you if you're Javanese. This is also a fun opportunity for me to work on my C++ and low-level concurrency skills.
